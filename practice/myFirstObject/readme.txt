In this code i have written a php code that has a class of a basket. the properties inside are the cost of the items thats imaginery and the shipping cost.theres also a discount.
what i have done is made a checkout subtotal calculating system. it takes the values outside the class and does the operation inside the function subtotal.
i have learnt this from my dad. he showed me how this works. In the project i have followed a youtube tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyRWaQo1pZo&t=0s.
i will learn more advance object and class from there.



Thanks!
